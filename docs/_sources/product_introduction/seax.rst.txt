Introduction
-------------------

SeaX allows you to integrate a virtual agent into your business's website and social media accounts to automatically handle incoming customer requests. Through the SeaX Collaborative Contact Center, **virtual agents** work hand in hand with your customer service representatives, or **live agents**, to address any and all customer inquiries quickly and efficiently.

SeaX Features
-------------------

The **SeaX Virtual Agent** can handle a wide range of basic questions about your business, addressing topics such as:

* location
* hours
* contact information
* amenities
* menu

For more complex questions that the agent cannot answer, the SeaX interface allows customers to request a **live agent**, or a human customer service representative available within the SeaX Collaborative Contact Center.

Here we demonstrate the SeaX Virtual Agent's live handoff capabilities:
