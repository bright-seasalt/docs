The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how the ngChat meeting RESTFul APIs can be used to retrieve meeting analytics. In this tutorial we will walk-through:
    - How to use the Summarization API to generate short and long summaries from a meeting transcript
    - How to use the Topic Prediction API to predict topics from meeting transcript
    - How to use the Action Extraction API to extract and summarize actionable items from a meeting transcript

The end result will be a robust set of meeting analytics.

Summarization API
=================

The Summarization API uses mBART-50 based summarization models to generate summaries of single turn utterances and full transcripts in multiple languages.
The tutorial will walk through the different API calls to access these models.
