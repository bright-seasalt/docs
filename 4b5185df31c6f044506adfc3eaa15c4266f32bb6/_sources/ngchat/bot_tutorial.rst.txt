The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how ngChat products can be used with Rasa chatbots. In this tutorial we will walk-through:
    - How to use ngChat Dialogue finite state machine-based policy for dialogue management
    - How to integrate ngChat Cart as a backend for e-commerce bots
    - How to incorporate ngChat FAQ for fast and accurate FAQ response

The end result will be a relatively simple cafe ordering bot that can answer FAQs, ask the user what they want, display the menu, and validate a user's item request. The bot will lay the groundwork for using all three ngChat compenents and can be easily customized or built-upon to work towards a more complex e-commerce bot.

Before Starting
----------------

It is highly encouraged that before starting this tutorial, you are familiar with `Rasa Open Source <https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/>`_. If you have not used
Rasa before, we suggest completing the `Rasa tutorial <https://legacy-docs-v1.rasa.com/1.8.3/user-guide/rasa-tutorial/>`_ before
starting the ngChat tutorial. Additionally, before starting *this* tutorial please initialize a new Rasa bot in a new
directory.

.. code-block:: 

    $ mkdir tutorial_bot
    $ cd tutorial_bot
    $ rasa init

.. IMPORTANT:: ngChat is built on top of Rasa 1.10.x, make sure you are using this version, or there may be compatibility issues. 

We will use this simple bot to walk through how to incorporate each ngChat component.  

ngChat Policy
----------------
ngChat Policy is a custom Rasa policy component. It will allow you to define simple and consistent rules for your dialogue flow.
The policy can be used as a stand-alone dialogue manager or can be used in conjunction with other Rasa policies. 
The tutorial will walk through how to add the policy to your configuration, how to write the dialogue states, 
and how to view dialogue states via dynamic visualization.

ngChat Cart
------------
ngChat Cart is a cart management backend for e-commerce chatbots. It will allow your bot to query a menu, customize items, and
modify the user's cart. The tutorial will walk through how to format the menu, configure the cart to work with your bot, and
use the cart methods in Rasa custom actions.

ngChat FAQ
-----------
ngChat FAQ is a fast and accurate response selector component for Rasa. The tutorial will explain why ngChat FAQ is a better
alternative to Rasa's ResponseSelector, how to set up the component, and how to format the data.
