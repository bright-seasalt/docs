There are three main ways to improve your Near Me Messaging virtual agent if it is struggling to respond to certain questions: filtering your Google Reviews, adding custom FAQs, and adding additional context.

Filter Your Google Reviews
==========================

You can control which of your Google Reviews are used by your virtual agent to answer customer questions on the Google Reviews. If a review contains inaccurate or outdated information, you can easily remove it from your virtual agent’s use.

To remove a review, uncheck the box next to it and click the submit button. The virtual agent will now only use the checked reviews when it searches for an answer to a customer question. The unchecked review will remain on the page if you ever want to include it again.

Add Custom FAQs
================

If you notice that customers ask particular questions a lot or see a common question in your unanswered questions, you can add a specific answer to those questions on the Custom FAQ page. This is the best way to improve your agent if you want a group of similar questions to be answered in a specific way.

To create a new custom FAQ, enter a question and answer, and click the arrow. You can now click Paraphrase the Question to add more questions that should trigger this answer. The more paraphrases you provide, the better the virtual agent will be able to use this FAQ. When you are done updating your custom FAQs, click Save All to save your new FAQs.

Add Additional Context
======================

The other way in which you can add more information for your virtual agent’s use is through the Additional Context page. This is the best way to improve your agent if you have a paragraph of information about your business that you want your agent to have access to. If you add information here, your virtual agent will search this context in addition to your Google Reviews when it tries to answer a customer’s question. The virtual agent will not answer with the full context paragraph, but may pick a section of it to answer a customer’s question.

To add new context, enter an informative title and the context, then click the check. When you are done updating your additional context, click Save All to save your new context.
